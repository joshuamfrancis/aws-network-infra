Comma-delimited list has each entry formatted as <ParameterName>=<ParameterValue> or <ParameterName>="<ParameterValue>,<ParameterValue>". A JSON file can be a local file with a "file://" prefix or remote URL. The file should look like: [ { "ParameterKey": "KeyPairName", "ParameterValue": "MyKey" }]

        # # The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to create the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. AWS CloudFormation always uses this role for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege. If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack
        # role-arn: # optional
        # # Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. This input should be JSON-formatted, for example [ { "Key": "string", "Value": "string" } ]

        # # Whether to enable termination protection on the specified stack. Defaults to '0' (terminated protection will be disabled) This input is only used for stack creation, not for stack update
        # termination-protection: # optional, default is 0
